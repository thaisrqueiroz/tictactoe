# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe Game

A classic implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game in Java, built with Maven.

## 📝 Description

This project is a console-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. Players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid, with the goal of getting three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

This project serves as an excellent learning opportunity for several key aspects of software development:

### 💡 Key Learnings
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Understanding classes, objects, and their relationships through the implementation of game components (Board, Player, Game)
- **Java Fundamentals**: Working with arrays, loops, conditionals, and user input handling
- **Project Structure**: Learning proper project organization and Maven build system
- **Testing**: Implementing unit tests using JUnit to ensure game logic correctness
- **Version Control**: Managing code changes and collaboration using Git
- **Documentation**: Writing clear and comprehensive documentation

### 🎯 Skills Developed
- Problem-solving through game logic implementation
- Code organization and clean architecture
- Input validation and error handling
- User interface design (console-based)
- Test-driven development practices

### 🌟 Future Improvements
This project can be extended in various ways:
- Adding a graphical user interface (GUI)
- Implementing an AI opponent
- Creating a multiplayer version
- Adding game statistics and history
- Implementing different board sizes
- Adding sound effects and animations

This project demonstrates how a simple game can be used to learn and practice fundamental programming concepts while creating something fun and interactive.
